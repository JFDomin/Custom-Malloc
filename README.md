# Malloc

## Description

In this project you will build your own implementation of malloc and free. That is, you will need to implement a library that interacts with the operating system to perform heap management on behalf of a user process as demonstrated in class. 

## Building and Running the Code

The code compiles into four shared libraries and six test programs. To build the code, change to your top level assignment directory and type:
```
make
```
Once you have the library, you can use it to override the existing malloc by using
LD_PRELOAD. The following example shows running the ffnf test using the First Fit shared library:
```
$ env LD_PRELOAD=lib/libmalloc-ff.so tests/ffnf
```

To run the other heap management schemes replace libmalloc-ff.so with the appropriate library:
```
Best-Fit: libmalloc-bf.so
First-Fit: libmalloc-ff.so
Next-Fit: libmalloc-nf.so
Worst-Fit: libmalloc-wf.so
```

The code will print the statistics ( THESE STATS ARE FAKE) upon exit and should look like similar to:
```
mallocs: 8
frees: 8
reuses: 1
grows: 5
splits: 1
coalesces: 1
blocks: 5
requested: 7298
max heap: 4096
```
